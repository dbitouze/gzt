gzt - Support for the French journal "La Gazette des Math^^c3^^a9maticiens"
=====================================================================

The `gzt` bundle provides LaTeX classes for the French journal "La Gazette des
math^^c3^^a9maticiens".

Installation
------------

The classes are supplied in `.dtx` format.  If you want to unpack the `.dtx`
yourself, running `tex gzt.dtx` will extract the package whereas
`pdflatex gzt` will typeset the documentation of the `gztarticle` class
(currently only in French).

Typesetting the documentation also requires a number of packages in addition to
those needed to use the `gzt` classes.  To compile the documentation without
error, you will need, among others, my personal (dirty) package `denisbdoc` for
documenting the classes I've written.
