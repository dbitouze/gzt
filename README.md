# Overview

The purpose of the current LaTeX bundle, `gzt`, is to provide two classes and
`biblatex styles` for
the French journal
["La Gazette des Mathématiciens"](http://smf4.emath.fr/Publications/Gazette/):

- `gzt` for the complete issues of the journal, aimed for the Gazette's team,
- `gztarticle`, intended for the authors who wish to publish an article in the
  Gazette. This class goal is to:
    - faithfully reproduce the layout of the Gazette, thus enabling the authors
      to be able to work their document in actual conditions,
    - provide a number of tools (commands and environments) to facilitate the
      drafting of documents, in particular those containing mathematical
      formulas.
